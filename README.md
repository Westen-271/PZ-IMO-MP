# Immersive Medical Overhaul
### A mod to overhaul the medical system and interactions between players, thereby making mechanical PVP in multiplayer engaging.


## Current Problems:
1. Time to kill (TTK) is too high (you can plausibly die in under a second, especially if the server is laggy).
2. Injuries are basic and can be fixed by anyone as long as they have the requisite items.
3. Level 10 first aid, outside of some specific server rules, does not do anything other than change the rate at which you heal.

## Aims of this mod:
1. Give the first aid perk more skill expression - make 10 first aid actually make a difference to give people a reason to reach it.
2. Increase the TTK in multiplayer PVP significantly.
3. Make the system more fun to interact with beyond "you're bandaged/stitched, now wait a week for it to heal".

## Systems:
### 1. Overall Health -> Blood Volume
### 2. Overhauling Death
### 3. New medical items to stop bleeding, with Sandbox settings to enable or disable based on year your server is based on.
- Tourniquets are always available and can be made or found. Tourniquets that are made have less durability unless done by a tailor.
- Hemostatics are available based on year, with different versions of Celox and QuikClot (including their own side effects).

### 4. Vital signs are added along with tools to monitor them, to help medics keep an eye on their patient.
